# madlib-generator

This is a Python program that prints a quiz string based on the 
desired difficulty of the user. The user is presented with 
different blanks that need to be answered correctly to be filled in.
Once the user has answered correctly then the program prints the 
same quiz string but with the correct answer filled in for the blank.
